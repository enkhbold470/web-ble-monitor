// Focus estimation from a raw EEG sample stream.
//
// The score is the **engagement index** of Pope, Bogart & Bartolome (1995),
// "Biocybernetic system evaluates indices of operator engagement in automated task",
// Biological Psychology 40(1-2):187-195 (PMID 7647180):
//
//     E = beta / (alpha + theta)
//
// Pope compared four candidate indices under closed-loop feedback and this one tracked
// task engagement best. It is the ratio neurofocus.dev is built on.
//
// E is an unbounded positive ratio, so it cannot be shown as 0-100 directly. We map it
// through a logistic in log-ratio against a **per-user baseline** E0 measured once at the
// start of a session:
//
//     score = 100 / (1 + (E0/E)^k)
//
// which is exactly 50 when E == E0, 66.7 at 2x baseline (k=1), and is monotone and bounded.
// The baseline is FROZEN after calibration, never rolling — a rolling baseline would drag
// the score back to 50 forever and erase the very drift we want to see.
