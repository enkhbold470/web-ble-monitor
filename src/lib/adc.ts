/**
 * - **v4** — TI ADS1220, 24-bit, differential/bipolar (signed full scale 2^23), external
 *   3.3 V VREF, PGA gain 1. Ahead of it sits `U12` (AD8422 instrumentation amp, G=100).
 *   One count is 3.3 V / 2^23 ≈ 393.2 nV at the ADC, ≈ 3.93 nV at the electrode.
 *   NOTE: the firmware's own `AFE_GAIN` is 1.0, so DIAG's µV are ADC-referred, not
 *   electrode-referred — they read 100x larger than the numbers this profile produces.
 * - **v2** — ESP32-C3 internal SAR ADC, 12-bit, single-ended UNIPOLAR biased at VCC/2.
 *   Codes 0..4095 span 0..vref, so full scale is 2^12 and the ~2048 mid-scale bias is
 *   removed. `gain` is the discrete two-op-amp AFE gain (≈ 11000 = x11 in-amp * x1000
 *   output stage, firmware/v2 schematic).
 *
 * `vref` and `gain` are HARDWARE CONSTANTS to verify per board. The ESP32-C3 ADC is
 * nonlinear and the v2 AFE output stage is frequency-shaped, so a single scalar gain only
 * approximates in-band µV. The 1 Hz high-pass downstream removes residual DC, so the
 * nominal `offset` need not track exactly.
